# Guided Project: Building a Handwritten Digits Classifier

Deep neural networks are being leveraged today for a variety of tasks. One such task is image classification. Image classification is difficult because each image highly dimensional and each pixel represents a feature. Thus, for high-resolution images, there can be millions of features. This requires a lot of computational power. To combat this, images are downplayed to lower resolutions. Deep neural networks can circumvent this issue through their ability to recognize complex nonlinear relationships.
